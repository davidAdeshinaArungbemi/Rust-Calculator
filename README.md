# Rust-Calculator
Trying to learn Rust. So I decided to create a calculator that runs in terminal :) It's a bit broken :) But it works Will try to update later
During this jouney, i had the following issues:
-Keeping track of what's going on in my code
-Debugging issues

Will work on planning my code better and learn better coding practices
